This preamplifier is designed to drive the analog-to-digital converter (ADC)
of an ATmega device, which in turn supplies the digitized input signal through a
USB port to the the lxardoscope_0.95 program.

Features:
	- 5V only supply from the USB communication interface
	- DC input range is -4V to +6V, with 10mV resolution
	- AC input range is 1Vpp, with 1mV resolution. 
	- high input impedance of 1MegOhm to reduce loading of monitored circuit nodes
	- input current flows to ground (not to some bias point, which can produce
		weird results on high impedance nodes)
	- standard 10X and 100X probes can be connected to increase the input
		voltage range
	- probes are terminated in AC mode (no danger of high voltage at the
		connection point with the preamplifier)
	- auxiliary negative supply is clocked synchronously with the analog-digital
		conversion process
	- GND offset calibration and AC/DC path selection controlled remotely from 
		lxardoscope GUI.
	 
	
The input voltage range of -4 to +6V was chosen to for the following reasons:
	- resolution is 10mV with 10bit ADC of the ATmega328.
	- signals in circuits with single 5V supply can be monitored with some margin.
	- signals which are symmetrical to GND can be monitored, up to 8Vpp

Two versions of the schematic are presented:  
	- Preamp_Atmega328.png: preamp with ATmega device and a TTL/USB converter
	- Preamp_ArduinoUno.png: preamp with Arduino Uno board.


1. Power supply
---------------
In order to keep the circuit simple, power is derived from the USB supply of the
host computer. The preamplifier takes the supply then either from the TTL/USB
converter or the Arduino board.
In order to process positive and negative input signals with respect to ground,
and terminate the input impedance to ground (instead of some positive voltage,
which can cause unexpected behavior when measuring high impedance circuits), 
a negative supply is required, either for the operational amplifiers or for a
resistor network, which was chosen here.  The ATmega device is used to generate
a square wave, which feeds a TC7660 charge pump circuit. This type of circuit
connects a capacitor (Cpump) in a first phase across the incoming 5V supply, and
then in a second phase in series with this supply, (positive side to ground),
and charging a storage capacitor to -5V. 
The frequency of the square wave signal is the same as the sampling frequency of
the converter to minimize interaction of the clock frequencies. Since the output
voltage might have significant ripple, depending on the size of the capacitors and
the load current, a voltage regulator is therefore provided to generate a smooth
and stable -3V reference. 
A design choice was to use +3V as reference voltage to the ADC, assuming that
the +5V rail from the USB supply is quite noisy. Thus an opamp is used in an
inverting configuration to produce the +3V from the -3V. It turns out that it is
beneficial for the input circuitry if the two supplies track. Adjustments
with the optional trimmer allow for balancing the two supplies.
In addition to the +3V rail, a +1.5V rail is required. A second opamp, in a
unity gain configuration, buffers half of the +3V supply. 
The MCP6002 opamp is probably not the best choice as reference amplifier,
because it does not like to drive capacitive load. Therefore there are no
filter capacitors on the +3V or +1.5V rail. Fortunately, this preamplifier is
not a low-noise application, and other noise sources seem to dominate the 
overall noise floor.  
 
2. DC Signal path
-----------------

The resistor network at the input of the preamplifier serves several purposes: 
	- shift and attenuate the input signal by a factor 10/3, such that the input
	  range of -4V to 6V is transformed into a range of 0 to 3V:
			input -4V -> output 0V
			input 0V  -> output 1.2V
			input 6V  -> output 3V
	- generate proper bias voltage for the following amplifier stage.
	- maintain input characteristics which behave like a 1 MegOhm resistor
		connected to GND
	- maintain a relatively high resistance in GND calibration mode.
	- protect the sensitive circuity from overvoltage

The network consists of resistors with 1% tolerance. In some cases, several
physical resistors have to be combined to produce the final value shown on the
schematic. See the separate chapter on the design process for this network.

In the following, the path for channel 1 is explained. Channel 2 is identical.
The input signal is attenuated to 90% by resistor R9 and switched through reed
relay U7 to a resistor network consisting of R25, R26, R27 and R28, which 
accomplishes level shifting and more attenuation. This produces an overall gain
of 0.3, a level shift from 0V to 1.2V, and an input voltage of 0V when the input
is left open. This resistor network ties into the +3V and -3V rails, and this is
the reason the two supplies should be balanced.
The output of the resistor network is fed to a buffer, which drives the ADC 
through an RC lowpass. Experiments have shown that a capacitor should be tied
to the ADC input, to absorb the charges injected by the internal switches of the
ADC. The resistor provides some decoupling, such that the opamp does not have
to drive a heavy capacitive load, which could lead to instability.


3. AC Signal path with 3X gain
---------------------------
Reed relay U6 switches the AC path on, when the U7 turns the DC path off. The 
two relays are controlled by the same signal from the ATmega, but the DC relay
has the fixed side connected to Vdd, whereas the AC relay is connected to GND.
R21 together with R10 at the input furnish DC resistance to GND. R23 sets the 
bias point at 1.5V for the opamp. The combination of R9, R10, R21 and R23
produces a combined input resistance of 1MegOhm. Resistors R16, R17 and R18 set
the amplifier gain to 3.33, with the operating point at 1.5V. The amplifier
drives the ADC through an RC lowpass, as for the DC signal path. With the atten-
uation to 90% by R7 and an amplifier gain of 3.33, the overall gain from input
to ADC becomes 3.0; therefore a 1V peak-to-peak signal drives the ADC input
to the 3V full scale. 
Note that this gain of 3 corresponds to a gain of 10 on the LXARDOSCOPE GUI,
because 10 is the ratio with respect to the DC gain. 
  
4. Ground calibration
---------------------
For a perfect circuit, the ADC produces a code of 409 or 410 with input tied
to ground:
				1024/3.0*1.2=409.6
Instead of setting this value in the software, a calibration procedure is provided
which actually connects the input to ground with a reed relay. The associated 
code is acquired and stored for subsequent measurements. 
For this calibration procedure, relay U5 connects the DC path to ground, U7 dis-
connects it from the input and U6 connects the AC path with the input, assuring
the proper input resistance. 

5. Measurements
---------------
The document LxaPreampMeasurements.pdf describes measurement results obtained 
with a soundcard and a program called LXSNDTEST, also available from SourceForge.

6. Notes about the design process
---------------------------------
In this section I explain some details of the preamplifier design for those
who want to understand more how the circuit works. While the presentation pro-
gresses in a linear fashion, the design process did involve designing, testing
and comparing alternatives in various stages.
In the following explanation, the symbol R is used for a unit resistor; its
value is determined towards the end of the design procedure.

6a: Schematic network1.png 
--------------------------
The goal is to find a simple network which attenuates and shifts the input
signal as follows: -4V ->0V, 0V -> 1.2V, 6V -> 3V. 
Figure 1: 
I found out quickly that at least three resistors and a reference voltage are
required. Here is a possible configuration. With an input voltage of -4V, we
want an output voltage of 0V. Therefore the voltage across r3 is zero; it's
value is undetermined. r1 has 4V across, r2 has 3V across, therefore if r1 is
chosen to have a value of 4R, then r2 becomes 3R.

Figure 2:
With an input voltage of 6V we want an output voltage of 3V. The voltage across
r2 is zero, it can be ignored for this condition. r1 has 3V across; r3 has also
3V across, therefore it's value has to be 4R.

Figure 3:
With an input voltage of 0V, r1 and r3 are effectively in parallel, with a combined
value of 2R. Therefore the 3V is divided into 5 parts of 0.6V each, with 2 parts
across r1 and r3, and 3 parts across R2. Therefore the output voltage is 1.2V.
So all input conditions specified above are satisfied.

Figure 4:
Another requirement for the network is that the input resistance is effectively
referenced to GND, as in professional instruments. A probe connected to the input
should be passive, meaning that no energy is flowing from the probe, AC or DC,
because this could disturb the device under test. The requirement means for our
network that for 0V input voltage, there is no current flowing in or out. There-
fore the resistor r4 is provided to sink the current which is sourced through r1.
The current through r1 is I=1.2V/4R. r4 has 3V across, therefore it's value needs
to be R=U/I=3*4R/1.2 = 12R/1.2 = 10R.

Figure 5:
Another requirement for the network is that there must be way to connect the
input to ground for determining the offset of the whole data acquisition circuit.
It is desirable to avoid shorting the input directly to GND. 
I considered the following switches:
- CMOS multiplexer: because the large input signal range, the circuit needs to
	be biased from the +/-5V supply. Some kind of level shifting is required for
	the control signal, because the ATmega output levels are 0 and 5V. Choices
	here are comparators or even optocouplers.
- the classical solution is a reed relay. 
Additionally, the internal circuitry should be protected from overvoltages (due
to static discharge or inadvertent connection with a mains line). This requirement
is much easier to fulfill if there is a fixed resistor in series with the input.
Resistor r5 represents this resistor. It would also protect the ground switch
from high current, if the preamplifier input was connected to a low impedance
circuit node when calibrating. The overvoltage protection circuit is
connected to the network side of the input resistor. If we choose a value for r5
close to 100kOhm, the protection does not have to be very strong: three small
signal diodes in series to +5V and one to -5V should provide adequate protection.

6b: Schematic network2.png
--------------------------

Resistor r5 from figure 5 attenuates the incoming signal before it reaches the
network considered in figure 4. I decided to have 10% of the attenuation on the
input resistor r5, leaving 90% of the input signal into the rest of the network. 
Thus the requirement for the network becomes:
	-3.6V ->0V, 0V -> 1.2V, 5.4V -> 3V.

Figure 6:
This is similar to figure 1, but the input voltage is -3.6V instead of -4V.
Thus the resistor voltages are 3V and 3.6V, resulting in values of 5R and 6R.

Figure 7:
This is similar to figure 2, but the input voltage is 5.4V instead of 6V.
Thus the resistor voltages are 2.4V and 3V, resulting in a value of 7.5R for r3.
 
Figure 8:
The parallel connection of r1 and r3 yields 1/(1/6+1/7.5)=1/(5/30+4/30)=30/9=10/3.
r2 is 15/3, therefore the 3V is divided into 25 parts of 0.12V each, with 10 parts
across r1 and r3, and 15 parts across R2. Thus the output voltage is 1.2V, same
as for figure 3. 

Figure 9:
In order to deal only with integers, the number of unit resistors has been multi-
plied by 2 (the unit resistor will be half of the previous value, but it's real
value will be determined later.)
Current through r1 is I=1.2V/12R; value for r4 needs to be 12R*3/1.2=30R.
The equivalent resistance seen from the input is ((r2||r3)+r1)||r4, or
1/((1/(1/(1/10R+1/15R)+12R))+1/30R)=11.25R .

Figure 10: 
This illustrates calculation for r5: starting out that r5 should attenuate by
10%, means that the network receives 90% of the signal. Therefore r5 needs to
be 1/9th of the the network resistance: 11.25R/9=1.25R. The equivalent resistance
seen from the input is 1.25R+11.25R=12.5R.

Figure 11:
The complete network, also showing the voltages on the three nodes for the
three operating points discussed before. 

6c: Schematic network3.png
--------------------------
When dealing with small signals riding on top of large DC levels, it is convenient
to use AC coupling in the signal path; traditional oscilloscopes have such a 
feature. While it is certainly possible to include AC coupling somewhere in the
preamplifier, the equivalent function of a highpass can easily be implemented in
software. The disadvantage is that the input signal has to be between -4V and 
+6V, in DC and AC mode. So it is not possible to display an AC signal centered
at 20V DC. But neither could we examine such a signal in DC mode. For signals
exceeding the range of -4V to +6V we just have to use a 10X or 100X probe, which
will give much higher input impedance as a side benefit. 

A more useful addition to the input stage presented so far would be higher gain
in a capacitively coupled AC mode, such that the resolution would be 1mV instead
of 10mV. From considerations on noise, the AC circuitry should receive the input
signal without attenuation. Since the previously explained DC path provides an
attenuation of 10/3, or a gain of 3/10=0.3, the AC path needs an attenuation
of 10/30, or a gain of 30/10=3.0 . 

Figure 12 shows the conceptual design of the DC path and AC path with gain. 
A resistor from input to ground, marked ??, has been added with respect to 
figure 11. The purpose is to bring the input resistance to exactly 1MegOhm. 
It's value can be determined once the absolute values of the other resistors
have been chosen. An optional overvoltage protection should be connected 
after the 1.25R input resistor. 
With an SPST switch, either one of the paths is engaged. In AC mode, the pre-
amplifier input still needs to have a DC path to ground, because if a standard
10X or 100X probe is used, the input would float up to the DC level of the probe
input. The resistor marked with ?? in parallel with the series connection of
1.25R and 22.5R provides this DC path. The opamp following the coupling capacitor
is biased at 1.5V with a second 22.5R resistor. For higher frequencies, where
the impedance of the coupling capacitor is negligible, the input resistance of 
the AC path is 11.25R, which is the same as the input resistance of the DC path.
The gain of the amplifier needs to be 3.333, which produces then with the input
attenuation of 0.9 a total gain of 3.0. 
In calibration mode, the relays must be controlled such that the input is
connected to the AC path; therefore the DC path is isolated and the GND cali-
bration relay cannot get high current. 

6d: Final values
----------------
The last step involves deciding on the absolute values of the resistors. The
input resistance of the circuit shown in figure 12 is 12.5R, as explained in
connection with figure 10. This value should be higher or equal to 1MegOhm.
In order to use resistors from the E24 series, I chose R=100kOhm. Thus the input
resistance becomes 1.25MegOhm. The unknown resistor marked with ?? in figure 12
has to be chosen such that the combined input resistance is 1MegOhm:
		R=1/(1/1Meg-1/1.25Meg)=5.0Meg .
The values of the other resistors then become: 125kOhm (non-standard), 3.0Meg,
1.2Meg, 1.0Meg, 1.5Meg and 2.25Meg (non-standard). The non-standard values
have to be built from a resistor combination. The schematics Preamp_Atmega328.png
and Preamp_ArduinoUno.png show these final values for the resistor network.

7. Conclusion
-------------
The initial idea of using a resistor network for shifting and attenuating the
input signal has been implemented successfully.
